# ✈️ Power BI Lab 5 – Airline Delay Causes Dashboard

This project was developed as part of my **ITI Scholarship** to analyze and visualize airline delay patterns using **Microsoft Power BI** and real-world data from **Kaggle**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify trends, causes, and performance patterns related to flight delays across various airlines and airports in the United States.

**Data Source:**
[Airline Delay Causes – Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses)

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

1. Connect and clean raw flight delay data in Power BI
2. Create a **Date Table** using DAX for time intelligence functions
3. Build **DAX Measures** for performance analysis
4. Design a **multi-page interactive dashboard** with meaningful insights
5. Apply creative visuals and drillthrough navigation for user-friendly exploration

---

## ⚙️ DAX Measures

Example measures used in the dashboard:

```DAX
-- Total Delay Minutes
Total Delay Minutes =
SUM('Airline_Delay_Causes'[CarrierDelay]) +
SUM('Airline_Delay_Causes'[WeatherDelay]) +
SUM('Airline_Delay_Causes'[NASDelay]) +
SUM('Airline_Delay_Causes'[SecurityDelay]) +
SUM('Airline_Delay_Causes'[LateAircraftDelay])

-- Average Delay Minutes
Average Delay Minutes =
DIVIDE([Total Delay Minutes], COUNTROWS('Airline_Delay_Causes'))

-- Total Delayed Flights
Total Delayed Flights =
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Airline_Delay_Causes'),
    'Airline_Delay_Causes'[Total Delay Minutes] > 0
)
```
